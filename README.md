# rust_random_walk
Single-process and multiprocess Python and Rust [native+cython bindings] implementation to compute the effects of simulation steps, n, and number of trajectory replicas, k, on the mean squared displacement for a 3D random walk for a brownian partical.

DISCLAIMER: The mini-project was for educational purposes only. I wanted to practice a new programming language [rust] and compare performance to languages I'm more familar with.
